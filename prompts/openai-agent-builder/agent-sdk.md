# Agents SDK

Learn how to build agents with the OpenAI Agents SDK.

Welcome to the OpenAI Agents SDK. This library makes it straightforward to build agentic applications—where a model can use additional context and tools, hand off to other specialized agents, stream partial results, and keep a full trace of what happened.

# inferpipe: Visual AI Pipeline Builder

## Executive Summary

inferpipe is a visual AI pipeline builder that helps teams build, test, and deploy intelligent automation without complex development. Our drag-and-drop interface lets you create AI workflows, test prompts iteratively, and integrate seamlessly into any application via simple APIs.

---

## Problem Statement

**For Businesses:** Product teams want to add AI features but building custom AI pipelines requires senior developers, weeks of work, and complex infrastructure setup.

**For Developers:** Every AI integration becomes a custom backend project. Testing prompts, handling errors, and deploying reliable AI workflows requires significant engineering overhead.

**Market Gap:** Zapier handles simple automations. n8n handles technical workflows. No platform combines visual AI pipeline building with built-in testing capabilities and production-ready deployment.
